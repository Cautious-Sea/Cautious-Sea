Programming Journey</h3></summary>
Let me tell you a funny story about how I became a programmer âœ¨
          
It all started when I was 14 years old. I was dreaming of enrolling in the best college in Moldova for an accounting course, since everyone in my family was an accountant. But at that time, I had already bought tickets to Greece, so I asked my sister to apply on my behalf. However, while I was on my way to Greece, my sister called me to tell that accounting course was cancelled and that I had been enrolled in a programming course instead.

I was devastated and couldn't stop crying during my entire vacation. I was ready to give up on my dream of attending the best college in my country and go back to school. But there was no turning back.

On my first day of college, the teacher asked if anyone knew what programming was, and everyone except me raised their hand. Out of shame, I raised my hand as well, but when the teacher asked me to explain what programming was, I was at a loss for words ðŸ˜†

That's how my journey to becoming a programmer started, with denial, acceptance, and eventually a passion for the field. From school, I had always been interested in computer science and video games, so I took additional courses and worked extra hard to learn as many programming languages as possible.

Now, I can't imagine my life without programming. It has become a part of who I am, and my goal is to use my skills to make our human future the best it can be. I want to create revolutionary software programs that benefit others. The possibilities are endless in programming, and I'm excited to see where my journey takes me next ðŸ’«
